## Introduction
Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data in the presence of adversaries. It involves creating written or generated codes that allow information to be kept secret.

## History of Cryptography
Cryptography has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations. Early forms of cryptography were used by the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans.

## Basic Concepts
- **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext.
- **Decryption**: The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
- **Key**: A piece of information used in the encryption and decryption process.
- **Cipher**: An algorithm for performing encryption or decryption.

## Common Algorithms
- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe.
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm used for secure data transmission.

## Applications
Cryptography is used in various applications, including:
- Secure communication
- Data protection
- Authentication
- Digital signatures
