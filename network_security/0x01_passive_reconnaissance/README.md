# Passive Reconnaissance

## Overview
This project focuses on passive reconnaissance techniques used in network security. Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target without directly interacting with the target system.

## Objectives
- Understand the importance of passive reconnaissance in cybersecurity.
- Learn various tools and techniques for passive information gathering.
- Analyze and document the information collected.

## Tools and Techniques
- **WHOIS Lookup**: Retrieve domain registration information.
- **DNS Enumeration**: Gather DNS records and subdomains.
- **Social Media Profiling**: Collect information from social media platforms.
- **Public Records**: Access publicly available records and databases.

## Usage
1. **WHOIS Lookup**:
  ```sh
  whois example.com
  ```
2. **DNS Enumeration**:
  ```sh
  dig example.com
  ```
3. **Social Media Profiling**:
  - Use tools like Maltego or manual searches.
4. **Public Records**:
  - Access databases like Shodan or public archives.

## Documentation
Document all findings in a structured format, including:
- Date and time of information gathering.
- Tools and methods used.
- Detailed information collected.
- Analysis and potential implications.
