## Introduction

Active reconnaissance involves interacting with the target system to gather information. This can include techniques such as port scanning, network mapping, and vulnerability scanning.

## Objectives

- Understand the principles of active reconnaissance.
- Learn how to use various tools to perform active reconnaissance.
- Analyze the results to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Tools

- Nmap
- Wireshark
- Metasploit
- Nessus

## Exercises

1. **Port Scanning with Nmap**
  - Perform a basic port scan on a target system.
  - Analyze the results to identify open ports and services.

2. **Network Mapping**
  - Use tools to map the network topology.
  - Identify key devices and their roles within the network.

3. **Vulnerability Scanning**
  - Conduct a vulnerability scan using Nessus.
  - Review the findings and prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation.
